‘These eccentric hurdy-gurdy instruments first created in 1913 still sounded musically radical after all these years.’– Roberta Smith, The New York Times
This concert, in association with Performa biennial, New York, and Thaddaeus Ropac Gallery, London, welcomes an extremely rare visit by Luigi Russolo’s infamous intonarumori (noise intoners). This will be the first time these instruments have been to the UK for over 110 years, since they set up camp at the London Coliseum on the eve of war in 1914. Russolo’s intonarumori mark the birth not only of noise music and sound art but of experimental music itself. 
Though most of the original instruments were lost or destroyed in the Second World War, composer Luciano Chessa faithfully reconstructed the intonarumori in 2009 for Performa, New York. Chessa's Orchestra of Futurist Noise Intoners will finally reach these shores on 17 January 2025 as the culmination of the London Contemporary Music Festival's 10th anniversary programme. 
Here – at the very same venue where Filippo Tommaso Marinetti first introduced futurism to Britain in a lecture in 1912 – Wigmore Hall and LCMF present a slate of UK and world premières for the intonarumori composed by Pauline Oliveros, Peter Ablinger, Ellen Fullman, Chris Newman, Jennifer Walshe & Tony Conrad, Pablo Ortiz and Margareth Kammerer.
The concert also includes two revivals of works that were first performed in 1913 and 1916, respectively, by futurist poet Paolo Buzzi and the instrument’s inventor himself Luigi Russolo, and Jennifer Walshe will perform three mysterious Irish Dadaist poems.
In the second half, Ensemble Klang performs OCCAM DELTA XXIII, a world premiere commission from the 92-year-old composer who gave birth to drone music, Éliane Radigue, working in collaboration with composer/musician Carol Robinson.`,programme_pdf_url:null,pieces:[{composer:"Peter Ablinger",title:"WEISS WEISSLICH"},{composer:"Chris Newman",title:"People"},{composer:"Pauline Oliveros",title:"Waking the Noise Intoners"},{composer:"Ellen Fullman",title:"Sunday Industrial – Post Futurist Reverie"},{composer:"Jennifer Walshe",title:"Fancy Palaces"},{composer:"Margareth Kammerer",title:"Blues or Woman in the Mind at Night"},{composer:"Pablo Ortiz",title:"Tango Futurista"},{composer:"Paolo Buzzi",title:"Pioggia nel pineto antidannunziana"},{composer:"Luigi Russolo",title:"Fragment from <em>Risveglio di una città</em>"},{composer:"Brian Sheridan",title:"BHAIDHLUGAENG"},{composer:"Dermot O'Reilly",title:"Foldada Dorchada"},{composer:"Dermot O'Reilly",title:"An Péist"},{composer:"Éliane Radigue",title:"OCCAM DELTA XXIII"}],venue:"Wigmore Hall",min_price:1800,max_price:4e3,is_wigmore_u35:!0,is_prom:!1},{id:"1737198000__wigmore_hall",datetime:"2025-01-18T11:00:00Z",url:"https://wigmore-hall.org.uk/whats-on/202501181100",performers:[{name:"Professor Johannes Meissl",instrument:"violin"}],title:"ECMA Masterclass",subtitle:"",description:"Violinist Johannes Meissl, Professor of string chamber music and Vice-Director of the Joseph Haydn Institute for Chamber Music at Vienna’s University of Music and Performing Arts, leads a masterclass session with rising-star ECMA ensemble the Novo Quartet.",programme_pdf_url:null,pieces:[],venue:"Wigmore Hall",min_price:500,max_price:500,is_wigmore_u35:!1,is_prom:!1},{id:"1737205200__wigmore_hall",datetime:"2025-01-18T13:00:00Z",url:"https://wigmore-hall.org.uk/whats-on/202501181300",performers:[],title:"Javus Quartett",subtitle:"Dvořák and Mozart",description:`From Mozart’s home city of Salzburg, the Javus Quartett formed at its famous Mozarteum and continues its studies with Johannes Meissl in Vienna.

Hexagons is a new work, co-commissioned by Wigmore Hall, inspired by the magical realism of Argentine author Jorge Luis Borges’s 1939 short story, 'The Library of Babel'. In this enigmatic narrative, Borges conjures a captivating and perplexing universe where the notion of infinity collides with the fragility of human understanding. Randomly arranged books fill the Library of Babel’s infinite expanse of interlocking hexagonal rooms, encompassing all knowledge that currently exists or may exist in the future while paradoxically offering no true enlightenment. Shaw and Kahane invite audiences to contemplate the joy, grief, wonder, and bewilderment that spring from a life oversaturated in information.`,programme_pdf_url:null,pieces:[{composer:"Caroline Shaw",title:"Fly Away I"},{composer:"Caroline Shaw",title:"and the swallow"},{composer:"Caroline Shaw",title:"Dolce Cantavi"},{composer:"Caroline Shaw",title:"How to fold the wind"},{composer:"Gabriel Kahane",title:"Hexagons"}],venue:"Wigmore Hall",min_price:1800,max_price:4e3,is_wigmore_u35:!0,is_prom:!1},{id:"1741519800__wigmore_hall",datetime:"2025-03-09T11:30:00Z",url:"https://wigmore-hall.org.uk/whats-on/202503091130",performers:[],title:"Schumann Quartet",subtitle:"Mozart and Smetana",description:"Known for its electrifying interpretations, the Schumann Quartet dives deep into Mozart’s ebullient ‘Hoffmeister’ Quartet and ‘From my life’, in which Smetana invited its performers to ‘converse together in an intimate circle about the things which so deeply trouble me’.",programme_pdf_url:null,pieces:[{composer:"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart",title:"String Quartet No. 20 in D K499 'Hoffmeister'"},{composer:"Bedřich Smetana",title:"String Quartet No. 1 in E minor 'From my life'"}],venue:"Wigmore Hall",min_price:1600,max_price:1800,is_wigmore_u35:!1,is_prom:!1},{id:"1741532400__wigmore_hall",datetime:"2025-03-09T15:00:00Z",url:"https://wigmore-hall.org.uk/whats-on/202503091500",performers:[{name:"Andrew Hamilton",instrument:"baritone"},{name:"Michael Pandya",instrument:"piano"}],title:"Andrew Hamilton baritone; Michael Pandya piano",subtitle:"I Heard You Singing -  Impressions from Eichendorff’s <em>Das Ständchen</em>",description:"Romantic poet, novelist, playwright and critic Joseph, Freiherr von Eichendorff made an enduring impression on German literary and musical culture.
