Hexagons is a new work, co-commissioned by Wigmore Hall, inspired by the magical realism of Argentine author Jorge Luis Borges’s 1939 short story, 'The Library of Babel'. In this enigmatic narrative, Borges conjures a captivating and perplexing universe where the notion of infinity collides with the fragility of human understanding. Randomly arranged books fill the Library of Babel’s infinite expanse of interlocking hexagonal rooms, encompassing all knowledge that currently exists or may exist in the future while paradoxically offering no true enlightenment.
