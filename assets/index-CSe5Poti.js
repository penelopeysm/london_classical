'We wanted to share our love of French song with a new generation of singers. Come and hear beautiful young voices in this rich and varied repertoire, with well-known and lesser-known songs. I hope that ‚Äì like me ‚Äì you will make some great discoveries!'.
Bizet & Ravel 1875 ‚Äì A Cornerstone for French Music
In 1875, Bizet died, a few weeks after his operatic masterpiece Carmen was premi√®red at the Paris Op√©ra-Comique, and Ravel was born at the border of Spain in the French Basque country. The Wigmore French Song Exchange celebrates this 150th anniversary with young singers and pianists exploring Bizet‚Äôs and Ravel‚Äôs musical worlds through their songs.
In the first concert of the series, the singers take on keystone works of the genre, from the ‚Äòclassic‚Äô style of Faur√© and Gounod to the ‚Äòmodern‚Äô style of Debussy and Poulenc. We also commence this year‚Äôs celebration of Bizet and Ravel, exploring their musical landscapes, particularly the Spanish influence.

PortaBanda is a handpan duo formed of acclaimed artists Rosie Bergonzi and Amy Naylor. Working together since 2022, they released their debut EP in 2023 and an album in 2024 following a world tour. Between them, the duo have 20+ years of shared teaching and performing experience and with Rosie‚Äôs grounding in classical percussion, and Amy‚Äôs upbringing in the British folk scene, they bring a unique and varied sound to the world of handpan.
The handpan (a steel drum like instrument, played gently with the hands) was first created in Switzerland in the year 2000, and is still growing as an art form. Rosie and Amy are pioneers of the instrument, being amongst the first musicians to play handpan in orchestras, pop music, as well as bringing the instrument to hospitals, choirs, festivals and more. Their chemistry is heart-warming, and with two of the widest smiles on the handpan scene, their music will leave you feeling inspired.`,programme_pdf_url:null,pieces:[],venue:"Wigmore Hall",min_price:500,max_price:500,is_wigmore_u35:!1,is_prom:!1},{id:"1753538400__royal_albert_hall__thetraitor",datetime:"2025-07-26T14:00:00Z",url:"https://bbc.co.uk/events/e2wcd4",performers:[],title:"The Traitors (3pm)",subtitle:null,description:"A spine-tingling celebration of musical treachery!
