Hexagons is a new work, co-commissioned by Wigmore Hall, inspired by the magical realism of Argentine author Jorge Luis Borges’s 1939 short story, 'The Library of Babel'. In this enigmatic narrative, Borges conjures a captivating and perplexing universe where the notion of infinity collides with the fragility of human understanding. Randomly arranged books fill the Library of Babel’s infinite expanse of interlocking hexagonal rooms, encompassing all knowledge that currently exists or may exist in the future while paradoxically offering no true enlightenment. Shaw and Kahane invite audiences to contemplate the joy, grief, wonder, and bewilderment that spring from a life oversaturated in information.`,programme_pdf_url:null,pieces:[{composer:"Caroline Shaw",title:"Fly Away I"},{composer:"Caroline Shaw",title:"and the swallow"},{composer:"Caroline Shaw",title:"Dolce Cantavi"},{composer:"Caroline Shaw",title:"How to fold the wind"},{composer:"Gabriel Kahane",title:"Hexagons"}],venue:"Wigmore Hall",min_price:1800,max_price:4e3,is_wigmore_u35:!0,is_prom:!1},{id:"1741519800__wigmore_hall",datetime:"2025-03-09T11:30:00Z",url:"https://wigmore-hall.org.uk/whats-on/202503091130",performers:[],title:"Schumann Quartet",subtitle:"Mozart and Smetana",description:"Known for its electrifying interpretations, the Schumann Quartet dives deep into Mozart’s ebullient ‘Hoffmeister’ Quartet and ‘From my life’, in which Smetana invited its performers to ‘converse together in an intimate circle about the things which so deeply trouble me’.",programme_pdf_url:null,pieces:[{composer:"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart",title:"String Quartet No. 20 in D K499 'Hoffmeister'"},{composer:"Bedřich Smetana",title:"String Quartet No. 1 in E minor 'From my life'"}],venue:"Wigmore Hall",min_price:1600,max_price:1800,is_wigmore_u35:!1,is_prom:!1},{id:"1741532400__wigmore_hall",datetime:"2025-03-09T15:00:00Z",url:"https://wigmore-hall.org.uk/whats-on/202503091500",performers:[{name:"Andrew Hamilton",instrument:"baritone"},{name:"Michael Pandya",instrument:"piano"}],title:"Andrew Hamilton baritone; Michael Pandya piano",subtitle:"I Heard You Singing -  Impressions from Eichendorff’s <em>Das Ständchen</em>",description:"Eichendorff's poem Das Ständchen speaks of an old man who witnesses a youthful serenade, causing him to look back upon his own life with contemplation.
