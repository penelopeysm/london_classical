In 1875, Bizet died, a few weeks after his operatic masterpiece Carmen was premi√®red at the Paris Op√©ra-Comique, and Ravel was born at the border of Spain in the French Basque country. The Wigmore French Song Exchange celebrates this 150th anniversary with young singers and pianists exploring Bizet‚Äôs and Ravel‚Äôs musical worlds through their songs.
In the first concert of the series, the singers take on keystone works of the genre, from the ‚Äòclassic‚Äô style of Faur√© and Gounod to the ‚Äòmodern‚Äô style of Debussy and Poulenc. We also commence this year‚Äôs celebration of Bizet and Ravel, exploring their musical landscapes, particularly the Spanish influence.

Bizet & Ravel 1875 ‚Äì A Cornerstone for French Music
In 1875, Bizet died, a few weeks after his operatic masterpiece Carmen was premi√®red at the Paris Op√©ra-Comique, and Ravel was born at the border of Spain in the French Basque country. The Wigmore French Song Exchange celebrates this 150th anniversary with young singers and pianists exploring Bizet‚Äôs and Ravel‚Äôs musical worlds through their songs.
The second lunchtime concert in the series continues our inquest into Bizet and Ravel, featuring unknown gems ‚Äì some receiving their first performance at Wigmore Hall. The scheme, which now includes both singers and pianists, aims to explore every layer of French song ‚Äì from the enchanting voice to the mystifying accompaniment. The concert includes solo m√©lodies, duets and even ensemble works.

Between them, the duo have 20+ years of shared teaching and performing experience and with Rosie‚Äôs grounding in classical percussion, and Amy‚Äôs upbringing in the British folk scene, they bring a unique and varied sound to the world of handpan.
The handpan (a steel drum like instrument, played gently with the hands) was first created in Switzerland in the year 2000, and is still growing as an art form.

In revolt, he founded the ‚ÄòSociety for Private Musical Performance‚Äô, a space where ‚Äì free from judgement ‚Äì Schoenberg and his fellow adventurers, misfits and radicals could indulge their love of popular music.
The Society rehearsed and performed at a ferocious pace, reverberating the leftfield utopia they‚Äôd created with the sound of stripped-back Viennese waltzes.

With his meticulous, almost mathematical approach to sound, Boulez took 20th century music apart and rewired it, changing its internal logic. In this concert, London Sinfonietta explores the chaos found within his fixed systems, and the volatile consequences of depth and detail.
Marking the centenary of Boulez‚Äô birth, the concert pays tribute to his adaptable approach to composition. Boulez had supposedly finished ‚Äò‚Ä¶explosante-fixe‚Ä¶‚Äô in 1971, but kept finding new life in it, growing it from a small-scale piece into iterations for electronics, orchestras and emerging MIDI techniques. Though the piece was initially conceived as a tribute to Igor Stravinsky, Boulez projected it into the future, reimagining the song for new times.
Throughout the performance, London Sinfonietta highlights both the complexity and possibility at the heart of Boulez‚Äô music.
For ‚Äò‚Ä¶explosante-fixe‚Ä¶‚Äô, flautist Michael Cox is accompanied by an orchestra in orbit. They respond dynamically to his playing, weaving together the piece‚Äôs network of finely tuned arrangements.

The programme centres on the UK premiere of Hough‚Äôs Piano Quintet ‚ÄòLes noces rouges‚Äô (The Red Wedding), based on a terrifying episode from Willa Cather‚Äôs novel My √Åntonia (1918).
Here, his colourful writing runs the gamut from a joyous evocation of young love and a rambunctious wedding feast to a frenzied, nightmarish sleigh ride. After he and the Viano Quartet gave its world premiere at Lincoln Center in November 2024, The Times called it ‚Äòone of the wildest pieces he‚Äôs ever written‚Äô.
The concert opens with Mozart‚Äôs lyrical and high-spirited String Quartet in B flat, K.458. And it concludes with Dvor√°k‚Äôs Piano Quintet No.2, blending Czech folk music‚Äôs soulful harmonies and energetic dance rhythms with the composer‚Äôs sunniest melodic inspirations.`,programme_pdf_url:null,pieces:[{composer:"Mozart",title:"String Quartet in B flat, K.458 (Hunt)"},{composer:"Stephen Hough",title:"Piano Quintet (Les noces rouges)"},{composer:"Dvo≈ô√°k",title:"Piano Quintet No.2 in A, Op.81"}],venue:"Queen Elizabeth Hall",min_price:1700,max_price:null,is_wigmore_u35:!1,is_prom:!1},{id:"1760121000__wigmore_hall__jakubjzefo",datetime:"2025-10-10T18:30:00Z",url:"https://wigmore-hall.org.uk/whats-on/202510101930",performers:[{name:"Jakub J√≥zef Orli≈Ñski",instrument:"countertenor"},{name:"Aleksander Debicz",instrument:"piano"}],title:"Jakub J√≥zef Orli≈Ñski countertenor; Aleksander Debicz piano",subtitle:"",description:"Few artists are as connected to the physicality of singing as Jakub J√≥zef Orli≈Ñski.

Their programme is bookended by Boulez‚Äô Anth√®mes 1 and 2, in which the violin is gradually surrounded by a spatial-effect halo of sound.
In between, there is a chance to explore music influenced by Boulez, firstly by his pupil Benjamin Attahir and the prominent French composer Philippe Manoury.
‚ÄòManoury and Attahir both worked with Boulez, but of course offer their own takes on the treatment of violin with live electronics,‚Äô Barenboim says.
Completing the programme are works from the Levant, by the Lebanese violinist and composer Leyale Chaker and Kareem Roustom from Syria, whose Pavane (pour les enfantes d√©funtes) receives its UK premiere today.
Barenboim says, ‚ÄòDoing justice to Pierre Boulez‚Äô work on the occasion of his 100-year anniversary means going beyond his own work,‚Äô adding that to present it as a static legacy would go against the visionary spirit of the composer.
Michael Barenboim is soloist and chamber musician on violin and viola, ensemble founder, concertmaster of the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra, and professor at the Barenboim-Said Akademie.`,programme_pdf_url:null,pieces:[{composer:"Boulez",title:"Anth√®mes 1 for violin"},{composer:"Benjamin Attahir",title:"Retour √† Tipasa for violin & electronics"},{composer:"Philippe Manoury",title:"Partita II for violin & electronics"},{composer:"Layale Chaker",title:"Before bloom for solo viola"},{composer:"Kareem Roustom",title:"Pavane (pour les enfantes d√©funtes) for viola & live electronics (UK premiere)"},{composer:"Boulez",title:"Anth√®mes 2 for violin & live electronics"}],venue:"Purcell Room at Queen Elizabeth Hall",min_price:3200,max_price:null,is_wigmore_u35:!1,is_prom:!1},{id:"1760292000__queen_elizabeth_hall__solomon",datetime:"2025-10-12T18:00:00Z",url:"https://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whats-on/solomon/",performers:[{name:"Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment",instrument:null},{name:"John Butt",instrument:"conductor"},{name:"Nardus Williams",instrument:"soprano, Solomon's Queen, Nicaule (Queen of Sheba), 1st Harlot"},{name:"Helen Charlston",instrument:"mezzo-soprano, Solomon"},{name:"Hugo Hymas",instrument:"tenor, Zadok"},{name:"Florian St√∂rtz",instrument:"bass-baritone, A Levite"},{name:"Choir of the Age of Enlightenment",instrument:null}],title:"Solomon",subtitle:null,description:`Handel‚Äôs colossal work tells the story of one of the Bible‚Äôs most prominent characters, King Solomon, with each of its three acts illustrating his different qualities and exploring the theme of leadership.

Conducted by Edward Gardner, this 1980s classic has become something of a speciality for the superb London Philharmonic Choir, and tonight, with the BBC Symphony Chorus joining the fun, it‚Äôll hit new heights of sonic ecstasy.

Neset‚Äôs saxophone serves as a waypoint. At its most tender, it can be an anchor, pulling him into the lush arrangements built up by London Sinfonietta.

Neset first worked with London Sinfonietta in 2016, unleashing the dizzying orchestral sprawls ‚ÄòArches of Nature‚Äô and ‚ÄòSnowmelt‚Äô.

The group takes its name from ‚ÄòZum Roten Igel‚Äô, or ‚ÄòThe Red Hedgehog‚Äô, the name of the major concert venue in Vienna in Schubert‚Äôs time ‚Äì but also of the tavern just behind it, where bands played and composers caroused into the night; at one point, Schubert even lived next door.
His fluid embrace of folk tradition in this much-loved work is brought out in this exciting version, reflecting the daring and profound qualities of the piece itself.
The connections between Schubert and gypsy music may not always be clear to audiences now, but they were strongly felt in his own time. The Hungarian elements in the String Quintet and parts of the Winterreise have been noted ever since they were written; Schubert also wrote a Divertissement √† la hongroise and there is a catalogue of other works that seem to reflect this style. His first devotees understood this, and there is even a romanticised 19th-century picture of him sitting and writing out the music in the countryside.
Schubert recognised the height of his own romantic aspirations in the see-saw between virtuoso abandon and deep pathos of gypsy music, and also the alienation and defiance that it represented.
In this performance, the artists‚Äô aim is to attempt to go through the looking glass to present the much-loved String Quintet in the full glory of its radicalism and originality.`,programme_pdf_url:null,pieces:[{composer:"Schubert",title:"String Quintet in C, D.956 rescored to include clarinet, santour & accordion and interleaved with traditional tunes"}],venue:"Purcell Room at Queen Elizabeth Hall",min_price:2200,max_price:null,is_wigmore_u35:!1,is_prom:!1},{id:"1764973800__queen_elizabeth_hall_foyer__afterdarkz",datetime:"2025-12-05T22:30:00Z",url:"https://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whats-on/after-dark-zri-cellar-sessions/",performers:[{name:"Max Baillie",instrument:"violin"},{name:"Matthew Sharp",instrument:"cello"},{name:"Ben Harlan",instrument:"clarinet"},{name:"Jon Banks",instrument:"accordion"},{name:"Iris Pissaride",instrument:"santour"},{name:"Zum Rotten Igel (ZRI)",instrument:null},{name:"Max Baillie",instrument:"violin"},{name:"Matthew Sharp",instrument:"cello"},{name:"Ben Harlan",instrument:"clarinet"},{name:"Jon Banks",instrument:"accordion"},{name:"Iris Pissaride",instrument:"santour (hammered dulcimer)"}],title:"After Dark: ZRI ‚Äì Cellar Sessions",subtitle:null,description:`ZRI‚Äôs Cellar Sessions is inspired by the cellar at The Red Hedgehog tavern in 19th-century Vienna.
This was where musicians from all scenes would meet after hours, and the boundaries between genres became blurry in tandem with the flow of beer and wine.
ZRI brings the spirit of The Red Hedgehog to life, where a Hungarian folk tune or Czardas dance may give way to some sublime Schubert or rip-roaring Dvo≈ô√°k.
For nearly a hundred years, the doors of The Red Hedgehog ‚Äì Zum Roten Igel (after which ZRI is named) ‚Äì opened onto the very heart of Viennese musical life.
The Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde established the city‚Äôs first public concert hall there, hosting regular premieres by Beethoven, and then Schubert, who lived next door at one point.
As if that wasn‚Äôt enough, the complex of buildings included a bar at the back with a vaulted cellar that later became Brahms‚Äô favourite haunt, where patrons caroused and who knows what kind of musical activities went on after hours.
The original building was demolished in 1906, but the spirit of the great composers feeding off the soundscape of a dynamic and cosmopolitan urban chic lives on in ZRI‚Äôs Cellar Sessions .
Schubert and Brahms were both fascinated by Hungarian ‚ÄòGypsy-band‚Äô music and it became as fashionable as the waltz in Vienna, with one of the tunes included here still part of the standard
